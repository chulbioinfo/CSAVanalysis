### Overview ###

The script to run 'fixed difference' analysis compares the position of CSAV in the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) file with the known SNPs in the chromosomal position. The script first converts the CSAV position in the MSA file to chromosomal position based on the BLAST output file and the chromosomal positions of CSAVs are then compared with population variant dataset (vcf file downloaded from Ensembl) to check if CSAV is conserved within the population data. The script here is unable to run on different dataset.
