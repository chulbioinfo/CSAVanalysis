Hi all,

 

While we are waiting to get Chul access to our cluster, I have attached the marker sets from the two RNAseq experiments below. One dataset is from scissor-microdissected tissue (micro_markers) while the other was obtained using laser capture microdissection (lcm_markers). Each set has three markers specializations: 1) general markers between the nucleus and its surround (i.e. spec_RA), 2) markers common to all nuclei or all pallial nuclei relative to their surrounds (i.e. spec_common), and markers uniquely specialized to one nucleus vs. all others (i.e. uniq_spec_RA). Chul, feel free to explore the convergent amino acid changes in both these markers lists, but please refrain from sharing any findings from the LCM collected set with others outside of our group, as I am currently working with this data for publication. Please let me know if you have any questions!


Best,

Greg Gedman
