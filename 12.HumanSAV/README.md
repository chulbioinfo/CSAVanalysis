# Overview
This section to idenify single amino acid variants (SAVs) specific to human mutually exclusive to non-human primates. It consists of 4 parts:

  |-Analysis: Script for SAV analysis, demo files, and descriptions to generate mutiple sequence alignments of the primate lineage.
  
  |-FOXP2: Example of famous human-specific amino acid variants on *FOXP2* known as language and vocal learning related gene
  
  |-Fig8_boxplot: Comparison of frequencies of human-SAV genes out of various types of genes, such as primate orthologs, pvian orthologs, AVL-CSAV genes, and ctrl-CSAV genes.
  
  â””-ConservedDomainSearch: Overlaps between vocal learner specific variants (AVL-CSAVs and Human-SAVs) and functional domains
